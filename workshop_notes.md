## Purpose 
This code defines a graphical user interface (GUI) for a PDF question answering system using Python. It imports several modules including os, tkinter, filedialog, pdfplumber, openai, and docx.

## **Save button** 

When the user clicks the "Search PDFs" button, the program searches all PDF files in the input folder and generates an answer to the question for each PDF file. The program uses the pdfplumber module to extract text from the PDF files and the openai module to generate answers using the GPT-3 language model. The program splits the PDF text into chunks of maximum 4096 tokens and generates an answer for each chunk. The program then concatenates all the answers for each PDF file into a single string and displays the final answer in the answer labelWhen the user clicks the "Search PDFs" button, the program searches all PDF files in the input folder and generates an answer to the question for each PDF file.
